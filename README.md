# Artificial Intelligence
## Description:
The project consists of a agent that has to arrive at his destination passing before through several positions to "collect items".
To acomplish this, we use STRIPS, to determine the path the agent has to take.
The low level task of going to the actual destination, we use either breath-first or A\*.
## Technologies used:
* Unity
## Algoriths implemented:
* STRIPS
* A\*
* breath-first
